# Inner Loop Subagent Prompt Template

Use this template when spawning the inner loop Task subagent.

## Template

````markdown
You are implementing part of a larger task. Work until complete, blocked,
or approaching limits (max 20 turns), then summarize and exit.

{{#if PROJECT_GUIDANCE}}
## Project Guidance

{{PROJECT_GUIDANCE}}
{{/if}}

## State Context

{{FULL_STATE_MARKDOWN}}

## Current Focus

**Work Unit:** {{WORK_UNIT_NAME}}

**Goal:** {{WORK_UNIT_CONTENT}}

{{#if KNOWN_BAD_ROUTES}}
## Known Bad Routes (Avoid These)

{{KNOWN_BAD_ROUTES}}
{{/if}}

{{#if VERIFIED_FINDINGS}}
## Verified Findings (Build On These)

{{VERIFIED_FINDINGS}}
{{/if}}

## Instructions

1. Implement the current work unit
2. Run tests as you go to verify your work
3. Use any tools you need (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep)
4. **Do NOT spawn subagents** - if work requires parallel execution, return to outer loop
5. **Do NOT commit** - the outer loop handles commits at iteration boundaries
6. If blocked (need decision, unclear requirement, external dependency), stop and report
7. After max 20 turns or if context feels heavy, find a stopping point
8. Return a structured summary in the format below

## Exit Criteria

Stop and return your summary when ANY of these apply:
- Work unit complete → set `status: completed` in summary
- Blocked → set `status: blocked` in summary
- Turn limit → max 20 turns reached, set `status: partial` in summary
- Context pressure → losing track of earlier work, set `status: partial` in summary

## Summary Format

When exiting, return this YAML structure:

```yaml
status: completed | partial | blocked
work_done:
  - "Description of what was accomplished"
  - "Another accomplishment"
blockers:
  - "Description of any blockers (empty if none)"
gaps_discovered:
  - "New gaps or edge cases found during implementation"
files_changed:
  - path/to/file.ext
  - another/file.ext
tests_status: passed | failed | not_run
next_steps:
  - "What should be done next"
  - "Another follow-up item"
engine: claude
```

Be specific in your summary - the outer loop will use this for review.

## Substitution Variables

Required:
- `{{FULL_STATE_MARKDOWN}}`: The entire state file content (frontmatter + body)
- `{{WORK_UNIT_NAME}}`: The work unit being implemented (section heading, criterion text, etc.)
- `{{WORK_UNIT_CONTENT}}`: Details about the work unit (section content, related context)

Optional (include if present in state file):
- `{{PROJECT_GUIDANCE}}`: Contents of .ralph.md if found
- `{{KNOWN_BAD_ROUTES}}`: Approaches that failed (from state file)
- `{{VERIFIED_FINDINGS}}`: Validated facts (from state file)

## Notes

The template uses mustache-style conditionals (`{{#if}}...{{/if}}`) for optional sections.
If a variable is not available, omit that section entirely.

Project guidance is critical context - always include it when available. It tells the
inner loop how progress should be tracked, what review expectations are, and any
project-specific conventions to follow.
