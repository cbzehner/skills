# Magi Reference

Provider details, normalization schema, and report template.

## Providers

| Advisor | Model | Unique Capability | Best For |
|---------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Gemini | gemini-3.1-pro-preview | Native web search (`google_web_search`) | Current info, API docs, library research |
| Codex | gpt-5.4 | Sandboxed code execution | Verification, CI/CD patterns, security |
| Claude | Opus 4.6 | Deep reasoning, project context | Architecture, code review, complex problems |

### Gemini CLI

Invoke Gemini directly with an explicit model and JSON output:

```bash
gemini -p "$(cat <<'PROMPT'
[advisor prompt]
PROMPT
)" --model gemini-3.1-pro-preview --sandbox -o json
```

Keep the model and output flags in the command rather than hiding them in a local
wrapper. This avoids wrapper-path drift when panel instructions are copied into
another skill.

**Metrics from JSON:** Token counts in `stats.models.<model>.tokens` (input,
candidates, thoughts, total). Latency in `stats.models.<model>.api.totalLatencyMs`.

**Setup:** `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli && gemini --login`

**Non-interactive auth:** `-p` mode expects `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Check
`~/.gemini/.env` first; this machine keeps the current Gemini API key there.
If the key is missing, create that file with `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key`.
Get a key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey. Never print or persist
the key in reports.

**Capacity errors:** On 429: wait 60s → retry once → skip.

### Codex (via adapter)

Always invoke Codex through [codex-adapter.sh](codex-adapter.sh):

```bash
bash codex-adapter.sh "$(cat <<'PROMPT'
[advisor prompt]
PROMPT
)"
```

The adapter prefers the companion plugin (HTTP transport to Codex app-server)
and falls back to `codex exec < /dev/null` with a 900s timeout. Never call
`codex exec` directly — it hangs in subagent environments.

**Metrics:** Aggregate token count only (single number, no in/out split). No
timing from CLI — measure wall time externally.

**Setup:** `npm install -g @openai/codex && codex login`

**Config:** `model_reasoning_effort = "high"` in `~/.codex/config.toml`

### Claude

**From Claude Code (host-native):** Task subagent — no CLI needed.

```
Task:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  model: "opus"
  prompt: "[advisor prompt]"
```

Don't use `claude -p` from within Claude Code — causes session contention.

**From Codex (external CLI):**

```bash
claude -p "$(cat <<'PROMPT'
[advisor prompt]
PROMPT
)" --output-format json
```

Check `is_error` before normalizing — `true` means auth or other failure.

**Metrics from JSON:** `cost_usd`, `duration_ms`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`.

**Auth:** Requires existing login. No env-var auth. Fails fast with "Not logged
in" if not authenticated. Must auth outside sandbox environments first.

**Setup:** `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

### Common Failure Detection

| Error String | Provider | Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Not logged in` | Claude | `blocked` | `auth` |
| `Failed to start OAuth callback server` | Claude | `blocked` | `auth` |
| `must specify GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini | `unavailable` | `auth` |
| `command not found` | Any | `unavailable` | `missing_cli` |
| Sandbox/approval rejection | Any | `blocked` | `permission` |
| Network timeout | Any | `failed` | `network` |

## Normalization Schema

```yaml
advisor_id: "gemini|codex|claude"
status: "ok|unavailable|blocked|failed"
summary: "1-3 sentence essence of the advisor's position"
assumptions: ["beliefs taken for granted in this response"]
information_gaps: ["what the advisor didn't know or couldn't verify"]
implications: ["consequences if this advice is followed, especially hard-to-reverse ones"]
evidence_basis: ["sources cited, code inspected, commands run, docs referenced"]
content: "full response or unavailability message"
```

These fields replace self-reported confidence with observable inputs:

- An advisor with many unstated assumptions carries less weight than one that
  made its assumptions explicit and justified them
- Incompatible assumptions between advisors often cause apparent disagreement —
  resolving the assumption resolves the conflict
- Information gaps that overlap across advisors represent shared blind spots
- An advisor that grounded its response in evidence (cited docs, ran code,
  searched the web) carries more weight than one reasoning from general knowledge
- Implications flagged as hard-to-reverse should bias toward the more cautious
  recommendation

Fields populated only when `status: "ok"`. Omit for other statuses.

## Synthesis Patterns

| Pattern | When | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Consensus** | Advisors mostly agree | Proceed; watch for shared blind spots |
| **Complementary** | Different but compatible | Combine strongest non-overlapping insights |
| **Conflict** | Direct contradiction | Compare evidence quality, prefer simpler/reversible |
| **Gap** | One advisor silent | Note gap; do not invent agreement |

Good evidence = specific references, tested claims, grounded in project
constraints. Weak evidence = vague confidence without support. When in doubt,
prefer existing project patterns.

## Synthesis
| Advisor | Key Insight |
|---------|-------------|
| Gemini | ... |
| Codex | ... |
| [Host Advisor] | ... |

**Consensus**: [What they agreed on]
**Conflicts**: [Disagreements and resolution]
**Recommendation**: [Your synthesized advice]

_Session saved to `[file path]`_
```

**Metrics availability:**
- **Gemini** (`-o json`): input/output/thoughts tokens + API latency
- **Codex** (`exec`): aggregate token count only, no timing
- **Claude** (host-native): varies; `-p --json` reports full metrics

Use `—` for unavailable metrics. Never estimate or fabricate.

Simple queries may skip collapsible individual responses — Quick Answer +
Session Metrics + Synthesis table is sufficient.
